This means you’ll be able to download a full HD film in around 3 minutes (compared to over 15 minutes on 4G).\n5G works at average speeds of 150-200Mbps, while 4G works at average speeds of only 23-35Mbps. By default, 5G will reach peak speeds higher than 1Gbps, but basic 4G works at a maximum speed of only 150Mbps.\n5G speeds can vary and depend on multiple factors: how far away you are from a mast, which spectrum is being used, and how many people around you are using 5G.\nMovies, gaming or music downloads are more convenient and amplified with 5G. If you have many different devices to connect inside a large home, 5G supports your experience on each device so that it’s seamless and uninterrupted."

            "question": "Where is 5G being used?",
            "answer": "Broadly speaking, 5G is used across three main types of connected services, including enhanced mobile broadband, mission-critical communications, and the massive IoT. A defining capability of 5G is that it is designed for forward compatibility—the ability to flexibly support future services that are unknown today."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do businesses use 5G?",
            "answer": "5G will support businesses’ innovation ambitions and create new markets, transforming supply chain management and creating smarter, more efficient manufacturing. It’s also a fundamental platform for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is expected that more than half of all new businesses will rely on the “IoT” to cut costs, build efficiencies, and grow their bottom lines."
        },
        {
            "question": "What new services will emerge from 5G?",
            "answer": "5G will potentially be able to handle more than 1million connected devices per square kilometer. This opens new opportunities for Smart Cities and Smart Homes. Other near-term services would include Realtime Gaming, and new opportunities in Entertainment with Virtual Reality and Augmented reality."
        },
        {
            "question": "What’s a “Smart City” and how will 5G impact my community?",
            "answer": "Smart cities employ use of electronic Sensors and Measurements to provide services and respond to challenges. For example, utility companies can have IoT meters to alert home owners on upcoming bills or to alert the utility company on leakages. Activity triggered sensors can alert in case of vandalism in isolated locations. Smart traffic lights can respond to traffic situation rather than work on a timer. Street lights can be controlled to respond not only to daylight hours, but also environmental situation e.g. Narrower streets can light sooner etc."
        },
        {
            "question": "How will 5G change transportation?",
            "answer": "There are opportunities in both traffic control and driverless cars. For the former, traffic information such as alerts on traffic jams, suggestions of alternative routes, real time traffic monitoring etc. are some of the use cases and for the latter we can’t reach the full promise of autonomous vehicles without 5G. For these cars to react to road conditions immediately, their sensors need to be able to send and receive data with low latency. 5G has the potential to cut latency down to less than 10 milliseconds, many times faster than the blink of an eye."
        },
        {
            "question": "Will 5G Improve healthcare?",
            "answer": "There are several opportunities in Health care as well. 5G could elevate virtual healthcare to new levels, enabling even more effective remote care for those who need it most. There is already ongoing research on capabilities such as remote surgeries by use of Robots and the 5G network."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are 5G antennas a health concern?",
            "answer": "All equipment used for 5G must comply with stringent safety standards. Those standards have wide safety margins and are designed to protect everyone, including children. Everyday exposure to the radio frequency energy from 5G small cells will be well within those safety limits and is comparable to exposure from products such as baby monitors, Wi-Fi routers, and Bluetooth devices."
        },
        {
            "question": "I have heard that 5G small cells cause COVID-19. Is that true?",
            "answer": "It is scientifically impossible for radiofrequency waves at any frequency to create a virus, including radio waves used to provide 5G. The World Health Organization and the CDC have been clear about the origins of this virus: The WHO says, “Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.” The CDC says coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats"
